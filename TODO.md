# Future Development

* scripts to do gridding of model output in geographic or geogmagnetic coordinates
* Better documentation of and code for scripts linking in the MAGIC neutral perturbations (J. Snively)
* Include scripts for linking to SIGMA scintillation model (K. Deshpande)
* Scripts and interface for generating initial conditions from global model output (or from globally run GEMINI) - isn't this handled by normal upsamplinmg scripts???
* Need a script that produces Pedersen and Hall currents for all frames
*
