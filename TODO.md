# Future Development

* X scripts to do gridding of model output in geographic or geogmagnetic coordinates
* modify gridding script to handle the 2D case (to geomag. only).
* X Better documentation of and code for scripts linking in the MAGIC neutral perturbations (J. Snively)
* X Include scripts for linking to SIGMA scintillation model (K. Deshpande)
* Scripts and interface for generating initial conditions from global model output (or from globally run GEMINI) - isn't this handled by normal upsamplinmg scripts???
* X Need a script that produces Pedersen and Hall currents for all frames
*
