# GEMINI-scripts
Auxiliary scripts for the [GEMINI ionospheric model](https://github.com/mattzett/gemini-scripts).


## Install

These scripts should be at the same directory "level" as `gemini`.
E.g.:

```
/home/username/
   gemini/
   gemini-scripts/
```
direc='./';
Simply `git clone https://github.com/mattzett/gemini-scripts`

### Requirements

either of:

* Matlab &ge; R2007b
* [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) &ge; 4.0


## Usage

The scripts are meant to "just work" without fiddling for a particular computer.
In terms of plot formatting, we prioritize recent versions of Matlab, particularly for generating publication quality plots.

### Top-level scripts

These functions are intended to be run by the end-user or automatically for various purposes.


under `vis/`:

* `magcalc`
* `magcalc_single`
* `magcompare`
* `virtual_spacecraft`

## Notes

### GNU Octave 

GNU Octave is compatible with most Matlab scripts, except those using proprietary Mathworks toolboxes.
Octave generally makes OK plots, particularly with the Qt graphics toolkit.
You can check which Octave graphics toolkit is active by:
```matlab
graphics_toolkit
```
```
ans = qt
```
Qt is the newest and best supported Octave graphics toolkit.
GNUplot is the oldest Octave graphics system and may not be able to make all plots properly.

##Example GEMINI simulations included in this repo

Several different examples are included with the source code; although initial conditions for each must be generated by the user by running a corresponding equilibrium simulations which generates balanced initial conditions for a given date, time, etc.  These equilibrium runs generally are started with a made-up initial condition so there is a lot of initial settling before a sensible ionospheric state is achieved.  To account for this one usually needs to run for about 24 hours of simulation time to insure a set of state parameters that are a good representation of the ionosphere..  Each of these examples has its own initial and boundary conditions generation scripts which are stored in the appropriately named directories in the `initialize/` directory, along with a `config.ini` file as input to the simulation.  The generation scripts must be run in order to produce input grids and initial conditions for each simulation.

The examples are labeled:

* ARCS_eq - an equilibrium (eq) simulation that generates initial conditions (ICs) for the ARCS simulation described below.
* ISINGLASS_eq - an equilibrium simulation generating ICs for the ISINGLASS simulation
* tohoku20113D_eq - eq simulation for 3D Tohoku earthquake simulations
* tohoku20112D_eq - eq simulation for 2D Tohoku earthquake simulations
* RISR_eq - eq simulation for the GDI and KHI examples described below (location:  Resolute Bay ISR)
* nepal20152D_eq - eq simulation for the 2D nepal earthquake simulation
* 2Dtest_eq - eq simulation for 2D test case that can be run quickly to verify the code is working correctly.
* tohoku20113D_medres - A medium resolution simulation in 3D of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.
* nepal20152D_highres - A high resolution simulation in 2D for the 2015 Nepal earthquake.
* tohoku20112D_highres - A 2D, high resolution simulation for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.
* ARCS -
* ISINGLASS - an example using model input derived from observations from the ISINGLASS sounding rocket campaign.  This example illustrates how to drive the model with data inputs.
* GDI_periodic_medres_fileinput - a simulation of gradient-drift instability illustrating the use of a periodic mesh
* KHI_periodic_highres_fileinput - a simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability illustration periodic meshes and use of polarization current solver
* 2Dtest - a quick to run (3 minutes on quadcore) example for testing whether the code compiled and runs properly.

A fair bit of testing has been done on these, but there could still be problems so contact a developer if you are having issues with the examples.
